La Huerta Grande, a Mudejar-style mansion, is a whole story in a single property. This palace would be perfect for a person who wants to invest in a property of this caliber, to create a boutique hotel or renovate it for private use. The property is in good condition, and would benefit from renovation to maximize its full potential.    We enter through the main private alley, leading to a courtyard with a parking area for 6 cars, and to the old stables as well as to the service and caretaker's property, now converted into 6 independent apartments, each with a kitchen area, living room/ bedroom, and bathroom.    The main area of the property is divided into 2 floors, in addition to the access to a tower overlooking the entire town of La Zubia, Granada and the Sierra Nevada (ski resort just 30 minutes away).    On the ground floor we have 5 rooms, the notary's office, 3 bathrooms, a kitchen, a large dining room with chimney, and two Andalusian patios.    On the upper floor, we find 4 bedrooms with 4 bathrooms, a large living room with a terrace, a large office with library, and 2 kitchens.    The exteriors are very relaxing, with tree shades, cool in the summer, ponds and a swimming pool.

One of its main natural attractions is the magnificent, 700-year old oak tree that presides over the Parque de la Encina, declared a plant monument and which used to belong to this estate. Excellent connections by AVE high speed train to Madrid, by plane from Granada airport (20 minutes away) and by motorway 99 km from Jaén and 120 km from Málaga.
