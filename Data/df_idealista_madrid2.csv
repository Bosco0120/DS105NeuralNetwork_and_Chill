In the front garden, we find a pond presided over by a majestic pine that sprouts from the very foundations of the construction.  We access the house via a small staircase, and we immediately witness the bright atmosphere that characterizes this home. The entire façade of this wing of the house is occupied by a huge window. Here we find the distribution corridors and the stairs to the two upper floors.  Crossing the hall, we access the immense living-dining room. A large window with motorized openings covers the entire front and separates the living room from the front porch and offers us beautiful natural views of practically the entire garden. Behind the porch, in the outdoor area, we find a circular pond in the centre of which is a spacious lounge, ideal for relaxed gatherings with friends and family. The pond also runs along the side of the house and has a safety platform, designed to prevent possible falls.  A large sliding door separates the living room from the kitchen, and once it is open it allows a fluid transition between both spaces. Following the same architectural philosophy, it has a façade covered with windows that provide precious natural light all day and spectacular views of the garden and the natural environment in which we find ourselves. Its exquisitely designed central island, the commendable storage space for kitchenware in the cabinets, the dining room and the comfortable pantry complete this dream kitchen.

On one of the best plots of the development, given its location, regular corner layout and size (more than 2,500 m²) is this wonderful house of very solid and robust construction, with a total of 600 m² and a beautiful garden that borders the house, fully consolidated approximately with tennis court and swimming pool.  It is well maintained, being ready to move into and also offering infinite possibilities for modifications or renovation, since it has a very square floor plan and lends itself to playing with the layout.  Your current distribution is configured as follows:  On the ground floor, crossing a charming main access porch, we find ourselves in the stately welcoming hall with a guest toilet and followed by an imposing marble staircase that connects with the rest of the floors. Often we have an office with possibilities; and in the background we access a huge living room with high, sloping ceilings, double height, with different environments, direct access to the dining room and garden.  On the left-hand side, we find a spacious renovated kitchen separated into a dining area and a work area; with also an exclusive laundry and ironing room. The kitchen also has excellent storage space, access to the garden and direct access to the stately dining room, which is doubly connected to the living room and hall.  To the left of the lobby is the bedroom area. In this area we have the large master bedroom, with an en-suite bathroom and walk-in closet; and two other bedrooms, both doubles with large fitted wardrobes and another bathroom to share. Ideal for elderly people or people with reduced mobility as there are no architectural barriers.  Going up the marble stairs, we first arrive at a large open room, very cosy and bright, with a fireplace and an open terrace; ideal to spend the afternoons and rest. On this floor we also have another bedroom with an open terrace and another complete bathroom. It is the perfect place for those looking for a little more independence or those who want to make a large-scale master bedroom.  The lowest floor is actually above ground, providing lots of natural light in all its rooms. This floor is made up of a wonderful and large meeting room, very cosy and made up of a cellar area with a bar, a lounge, a billiards area, a service bedroom, two storage rooms, two bathrooms, and a large garage with space for up to 3 cars.  This floor allows an extension of 70 m², being prepared for it and also having lights on the main façade. Its direct access to the garden makes this room perhaps one of the most important in the house, since it is used during all seasons of the year and for any type of event.  Undoubtedly one of the greatest virtues of this beautiful villa is its mature garden, large and with various aspects. It offers a magnificent swimming pool with lighting, a tennis court with infinite possibilities, a solarium area, a covered porch and an excellent premium built-in barbecue.  In Valdepastores we can find nearby shopping areas, as well as the Colegio Virgen de Europa educational centres and the Francisco de Vitoria University, among other offers.

Its distribution is developed in three heights, where the main floor gives away its entire surface to a large living room with several very cozy environments and a large amount of light that causes a special joy. The kitchen also has a singular relevance since it occupies the entire lower floor. It has been structured with a large amount of storage furniture and an island in the center that accompanies a generous dining room, an office area and a complete bathroom. The area where the rooms are located has three double bedrooms, including one with a dressing room and bathroom, and an additional full bathroom. The house has a covered and closed garage for a large car from which you can access the chalet itself. The plot occupies about 330 square meters, including the ground floor of the house, with a beautiful garden, its own swimming pool, a very pleasant porch with a pergola that can be seen very well in the photographic report and a glass-enclosed shed of exceptional quality and which serves, in this case, as a private office. This very special semi-detached house is located a few minutes walk from schools as renowned as San José de Cluny, Alarcón school, Liceo Sorolla or Escolapios. Also noteworthy is the proximity to the Hipercor de Pozuelo and the exit to the Carretera de la Coruña or the M40.

Well, let me tell you that you no longer have to give up anything, since today I bring you an absolutely impeccable, technological, very efficient property, in a luxury urbanization, where quality, light and spaciousness are its differential elements. THIS HOUSE IS SPECIAL BECAUSE -Because we are facing a MODERN HOUSING, with a minimalist design, practically new, with 5 bedrooms (2 suites and one on the street level), which has the highest quality and construction innovations, located in a spectacular location. -Because we are facing a CORNER HOUSE.I'm telling you, because in this complex there are three types of houses, and the corners are much bigger than all the others.To give you an idea, in corner homes you could put an elevator in the stairwell if you wish, since you have more than enough space. -Because you and your children will feel like you are living in a LUXURY RESORT 356 days a year.More than an urbanization, I would say that we are facing a residential complex, a unique innovative concept in the area: 15,000 m2 with a huge swimming pool for adults and another for children, two paddle tennis courts and one tennis court, gym, running circuit , bar area, gourmet social room, beauty salon, study room, changing rooms and toilets, and Wi-Fi in the central area of the common areas.In addition, the project has included a playground and a games room for children, where they can enjoy playing in a protected environment.

The heating is individual by natural gas (radiators) and air conditioning. The Barrio de Salamanca, without a doubt, the select district par excellence of Madrid. Strolling through its streets is like contemplating the most elegant and coveted buildings in the capital: historic constructions with stately portals and wide, tall interiors. Conceived in the last decades of the XIX century by D. Jose de Salamanca and Mayol, Marqués de Salamanca, this widening of the city preserves its aristocratic air intact, which we can see in palaces like that of the Italian Embassy, for example. The well-known “Golden Mile” is located in this epicenter of luxury, an area that houses the best national and international fashion and jewelry firms. Its culinary offer is infinite.

Now, the dependence on the car or a driver for any travel is inevitable. Those who seek exclusivity, tradition and, above all, a central area find in El Viso their ideal home. Important intellectuals and politicians such as Ortega y Gasset, Rafael Sánchez Mazas and Salvador de Madariaga have lived in this emblematic colony of the rationalist period in Madrid. Later it became the home of former minister Miguel Boyer and Isabel Preysler, before building their house in Puerta de Hierro; or the former model Mar Flores. In 2008, Ana Aznar and her husband Alejandro Agag bought a single-family home for 2.5 million euros. In 2012, footballer Xabi Alonso moved there with his wife, Nagore Aramburu. Now the couple lives in Munich (Germany). Exclusive schools Its strategic location, central neighborhood and very well connected, has prompted many others to establish their businesses in the area. This is the case of Ramón Calderón, former president of Real Madrid, who has his office there, or that of the prestigious interior architect Isabel López Quesada, who has found in Viso the ideal place to install her spectacular showroom. The educational offer of El Viso is not negligible either. In the past, you could see Infanta Doña Elena and Jaime de Marichalar walking through its streets on the way to pick up their children (Felipe Juan Froilán and Victoria Federica) from the San Patricio school, located on Serrano street. Also in this neighborhood is the prestigious Colegio Estilo, where Ernesto Alterio and Juana Acosta educate their children. Although today it shines with all its splendor, its origins are more than humble. The prestigious neighborhood was born by the hand of the architect Rafael Bergamín - brother of the writer of the generation of 27, José Bergamín - in the 30s of the last century with a social vocation and second homes.

Located in one of the city's most prestigious developments, with beautiful gardens, a private swimming pool and views of the Madrid skyline.  The creative blend of styles lends this unique home an eclectic feel and a unique personality. Some parts, such as the garden and the swimming pool, make you feel like you're soaking up the Mediterranean rays in Ibiza; others, like the hall and the porch, bring a more colonial, Mexican hacienda vibe, with an original outside design featuring weathering steel accents. This stunning Mexican hacienda-inspired property with a hint of the Med is located near Aravaca by the Puerta de Hierro golf club, just minutes from peaceful green spaces such as El Pardo and La Casa de Campo, prestigious international schools and the hustle and bustle of the big city. The primary residence spans 740 sqm over three floors, set on a beautifully landscaped 2,500 sqm plot with everything you could ever need for downtime and leisure. As we pass through the main entrance - a crown-shaped show-stopper with white, arched, lacquered wood doors - we find ourselves in a sweeping 50 sqm entrance hall leading onto various different spaces. The eye is instantly drawn to a spectacular staircase framing the stunning chandelier which, suspended from a domed ceiling, casts its glow throughout this elegant space. Each of the rooms features a large fireplace and has been carefully designed with large windows to make the most of natural light, another strong point of this beautiful home. Also on the ground floor are two generously-proportioned bedrooms with garden views and the staff area, including a full kitchen and food-prep area, a pantry, a staff bedroom with its own private bathroom and a laundry area. The kitchen opens onto the rear section of the garden and the barbecue area, and onto a charming dining room which leads in turn to the main living room. This spacious, inviting room offers views of the main area of the garden and the pool through one of the porches, which has been equipped for use all year round. The immaculately landscaped garden is spectacular, with well-established plant life and a large Ibiza-inspired pool. The property has several living rooms, as well as a summer dining area and sports facilities including its own padel and basketball courts. Access to the first floor is via an impressive American oak staircase; this level features three large, 30 sqm bedrooms, each with its own en-suite bathroom. The main bedroom has its own private living space with a fireplace, a private dressing room and a stunning, 18 sqm Travertine marble bathroom. The main bedroom offers access - via a beautiful spiral staircase - to another of the property's star features: the tower, which is currently used as a study/workshop and affords spectacular views of the Madrid skyline, as well as a spacious sun deck. An unfinished, full-floor basement area, accessible from the rear section of the garden, offers the perfect opportunity to expand the property should you wish to. The property has been exquisitely refurbished with high-end materials, and every room has been carefully designed to enhance its own particular characteristics.
