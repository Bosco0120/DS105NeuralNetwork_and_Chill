The result for the Quintana family was a magnificent flat estate of 13,300 m², fully enclosed with high walls, and the renovated 3-storey Mansion, house for caretakers, pediment and service area, all set amid lush trees, gardens and bucolic corners. where they enjoyed their retirement. In 2004 it was acquired and completely renovated, expanding auxiliary buildings to a total of 850 m² for use as a residence for the elderly until 2015, the end date of the activity.The reform provided the palace with an elevator, and the complex with a total of 25 rooms and 15 adapted bathrooms, 6 toilets, dining rooms, and an industrial kitchen and other units for sanitary uses.However, its exquisite façade was maintained, as was the entire ground floor of the palace, where its spacious hall and staircase, the tapestry room, its chapel, and the east room stand out... Today the property is a haven of peace and intimacy within the Sopuerta Valley, located 14 km from Castro Urdiales and 29 km from Bilbao.In addition, other complementary provisions can be made within the large area of the property, such as a swimming pool, garage, even a heliport.
