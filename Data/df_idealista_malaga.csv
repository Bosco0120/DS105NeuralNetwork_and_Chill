The materials used in its construction (cobblestones of the outside space, green glazed ceramic roof tiles, really typical in Pedregalejo, rough bricks in the terrace, wood doors and windows, pieces of glass and shutters), its thorough decoration (centenary doors, bars and wrought-iron stairs) and an old stone fountain, which is a detail of the original house that has been preserved, grant this house a marked Andalusian character.
