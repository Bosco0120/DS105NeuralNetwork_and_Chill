The Eixample district is the most emblematic of Barcelona since the nineteenth century. Of a renowned model urban planning devised by the engineer Ildefons Cerdá, Eixample marks the epicenter of the city from its main streets: The luxurious Passeig de Gràcia, the commercial Rambla de Catalunya and the updated Passeig de Sant Joan, housing the majority of the modernist architectural icons, such as La Sagrada Familia, La Pedrera or La Casa Batlló of the great Antoni Gaudí. It is a large, quiet but exciting  residential area with extremely convenient commercial activity, designed to respect the privacy of the homes. The Catalan modernist architecture so characteristic of stately airs, but with great cosmopolitan touches, extends throughout the neighborhood to the delight of those who wish to live modernism from within, since it is possible to acquire homes within regal estates with valuable original architectural elements, period pieces and even historical and protected. Schools, squares, wadis, parks, stores and restaurants give dynamism to the area that differentiates the Right from the Left, both with wide uniform streets, octagonal islands and wide island interiors that mark the internal distribution of buildings and homes. You will mostly find buildings of strong bricks, floors of generally wide dimensions, medium or high ceilings, with balconies that give to the wide streets or the inner patios of the Cerdá Plan. Keep in mind this living in the Eixample district, if you are looking for a neighborhood where you can have everything within walking distance or very well connected to public transport, both basic and luxury stores, trendy restaurants or even your workplace among the many offices and stores, this could be your neighborhood. If you want to walk among the iconic monuments of the city, with the comfort of equal distance to any other point or neighborhood in the city.

The district is the result of one of the most splendid moments in the history of the city, when it is definitively configured as the engine of contemporary Catalonia and breaks with the medieval past by tearing down the walls.L’Eixample was built in the years of the industrialization of Catalonia, at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th.The central part, the Dreta de l’Eixample, was the neighborhood of the bourgeoisie that introduced its own style to its house, modernism. Modernism Lluís Domènech i Montaner, Josep Puig i Cadafalch, Josep Maria Jujol, Antoni Gaudí and many other architects created, little by little, the new district.Thus began a new style that moved away from the monotony of the dominant eclecticism up to that moment.Modernism: A style present in buildings of great heritage value that make the center of the district a unique architectural complex in all of Europe.Modernist architecture mixed the new techniques and materials of the moment with the use of resources provided by the various traditional decorative techniques: stucco, sgraffito, leaded stained glass, wrought iron.The work of the artisans was put at the service of the design and conception of modernist architects.A new architecture and a new concept of space that collected the old techniques of tradition and the most innovative, all in a harmony at the service of creative freedom, which year after year attracts the eyes of visitors from all over the world. La Derecha del Eixample is an opulent neighborhood defined by Antoni Gaudí's iconic architecture, with Casa Batlló, La Pedrera, and its wide avenues lined with modernist apartment blocks.Passeig de Gràcia and Rambla de Catalunya are full of international boutiques.",False,good,False,True,7353.0,False,False,False,False,,False,False,,,flat,"La Dreta de l'Eixample, Barcelona",Flat in Calle de Provença,,,

The Eixample district is the most emblematic of Barcelona since the nineteenth century. Of a renowned model urban planning devised by the engineer Ildefons Cerdá, Eixample marks the epicenter of the city from its main streets: The luxurious Passeig de Gràcia, the commercial Rambla de Catalunya and the updated Passeig de Sant Joan, housing the majority of the modernist architectural icons, such as La Sagrada Familia, La Pedrera or La Casa Batlló of the great Antoni Gaudí. It is a large, quiet but exciting  residential area with extremely convenient commercial activity, designed to respect the privacy of the homes. The Catalan modernist architecture so characteristic of stately airs, but with great cosmopolitan touches, extends throughout the neighborhood to the delight of those who wish to live modernism from within, since it is possible to acquire homes within regal estates with valuable original architectural elements, period pieces and even historical and protected. Schools, squares, wadis, parks, stores and restaurants give dynamism to the area that differentiates the Right from the Left, both with wide uniform streets, octagonal islands and wide island interiors that mark the internal distribution of buildings and homes. You will mostly find buildings of strong bricks, floors of generally wide dimensions, medium or high ceilings, with balconies that give to the wide streets or the inner patios of the Cerdá Plan. Keep in mind this living in the Eixample district, if you are looking for a neighborhood where you can have everything within walking distance or very well connected to public transport, both basic and luxury stores, trendy restaurants or even your workplace among the many offices and stores, this could be your neighborhood. If you want to walk among the iconic monuments of the city, with the comfort of equal distance to any other point or neighborhood in the city.

The refurbishment of this beautiful building from 1871 will offer a distribution of four different apartments per floor and two stunning penthouses with private terraces and plenty of outdoor space. Taking into account that it is a corner building, the apartments will offer a very functional distribution in which all spaces are wisely used and will offer several exterior balconies that will allow a lot of natural light and amazing views. All apartments will be between 98 and 130 m2 and will offer 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms plus a fourth typology that will offer a unique and contemporary loft concept with very open spaces and features that stand out from the typical Eixample apartment. The fully equipped and modern kitchen will be open plan with the living area and most of the apartments will enjoy exposed wooden beams on the ceilings which will also give a certain character to the property.

The two penthouses of the building will be of contemporary design and will offer a sensational exterior exposure and outdoor space that allows views of one of the most sought after pedestrian streets in the city; Rambla de Catalunya. The location of this project needs no further introduction, as Rambla de Catalunya is synonymous with prime location in Barcelona and is located in the heart of the ""Golden Square"" that historically made Barcelona world famous for its beautiful and revolutionary Art Nouveau architecture. Right on the doorstep is Paseo de Gracia, Plaza Catalunya and some of the best gastronomy and shopping this magnificent city has to offer. The Eixample district is the most emblematic of Barcelona since the nineteenth century. Of a renowned model urban planning devised by the engineer Ildefons Cerdá, Eixample marks the epicenter of the city from its main streets: The luxurious Passeig de Gràcia, the commercial Rambla de Catalunya and the updated Passeig de Sant Joan, housing the majority of the modernist architectural icons, such as La Sagrada Familia, La Pedrera or La Casa Batlló of the great Antoni Gaudí. It is a large, quiet but exciting  residential area with extremely convenient commercial activity, designed to respect the privacy of the homes. The Catalan modernist architecture so characteristic of stately airs, but with great cosmopolitan touches, extends throughout the neighborhood to the delight of those who wish to live modernism from within, since it is possible to acquire homes within regal estates with valuable original architectural elements, period pieces and even historical and protected. Schools, squares, wadis, parks, stores and restaurants give dynamism to the area that differentiates the Right from the Left, both with wide uniform streets, octagonal islands and wide island interiors that mark the internal distribution of buildings and homes. You will mostly find buildings of strong bricks, floors of generally wide dimensions, medium or high ceilings, with balconies that give to the wide streets or the inner patios of the Cerdá Plan. Keep in mind this living in the Eixample district, if you are looking for a neighborhood where you can have everything within walking distance or very well connected to public transport, both basic and luxury stores, trendy restaurants or even your workplace among the many offices and stores, this could be your neighborhood.

However, until the end of the 19th century, this area was full of fields, factories and mills. Barcelona was a city overcrowded and drowned between walls. When these walls fell, the Eixample was born. The old industrial areas were demolished as the city grew. The few structures that survived were redesigned and reconverted. Sharing the patio with this outstanding residential project, is a restored original flour mill that has become a classic example of brick architecture of the time.

It is one of the greenest districts of the city and, together with Horta-Guinardó, the gateway to the Sierra de Collserola natural park, the most important lung in Barcelona. This proximity marks its status as a residential and affluent area, with numerous parks and green areas, combined with prestigious educational and health centers. The district is the sum of old municipalities added to Barcelona, such as Sarrià (1921), Vallvidrera-Les Planes (annexed to Sarrià in 1890) and Sant Gervasi de Cassoles (1897). Sarrià maintains the unity of the old town, although this nucleus is separated from the Three Towers due to its homogeneous urban characteristics and the high degree of recognition it has by its inhabitants. Sarrià-Sant Gervasi is a nucleus with a town feel, made up of the neighborhoods of Sarrià, Las Tres Torres, Sant Gervasi-la Bonanova, Sant Gervasi-Galvany, Vallvidrera, Tibidabo i les Planes and Putxet i el Farró.",False,renew,False,True,6225.0,True,False,True,False,,False,False,True,True,flat,"Les Tres Torres, Barcelona",Flat,,,

This proximity marks its status as a residential and affluent area, with numerous parks and green areas, combined with prestigious educational and health centers. The district is the sum of old municipalities added to Barcelona, such as Sarrià (1921), Vallvidrera-Les Planes (annexed to Sarrià in 1890) and Sant Gervasi de Cassoles (1897). Sarrià maintains the unity of the old town, although this nucleus is separated from the Three Towers due to its homogeneous urban characteristics and the high degree of recognition it has by its inhabitants. Sarrià-Sant Gervasi is a nucleus with a town feel, made up of the neighborhoods of Sarrià, Las Tres Torres, Sant Gervasi-la Bonanova, Sant Gervasi-Galvany, Vallvidrera, Tibidabo i les Planes and Putxet i el Farró.",False,renew,False,True,6225.0,True,False,True,False,,False,False,True,True,flat,"Les Tres Torres, Barcelona",Flat,,,
