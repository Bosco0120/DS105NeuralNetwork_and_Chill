This house is unique because it is part of the Rivero Building, protected according to the Architectural Heritage catalog for being the work of the famous rationalist architect Miguel Martín-Fernández De la Torre. The location could not be better.Ciudad Jardín in essence with all services just a few steps away. We also consider it unique due to its orientation, with windows facing three streets, which gives it incredible light throughout the day and views of the sea from several of its rooms.We also like that it is located on the second and top floor of the building It is unique for its original ceilings, 3 meters high, and for all those little details that they thought of when completely renovating it 6 years ago. The interior carpentry, solid white lacquered wood, is wonderful.It was made to measure respecting the original parts of the house to the millimeter.This includes the armored main access door to the house (because it has two entrances).Equally special are the high skirting boards and the warmth provided by the wooden floor. Another thing that makes it unique is the fact that it has a private elevator.Very few houses of this historical value and in this area have this tool that makes our day to day much more practical. And its distribution, of course.There are 171m2 of housing that include a super spacious and bright dining room.Its independent kitchen is modern and functional and is also equipped with the best materials and has a perfect terrace to have the first coffee of the day in the sun.The apartment has 4 rooms, two of which are very good-sized bedrooms, a custom-made office and a dressing room with an integrated full bathroom. The built-in wardrobes, used up to the ceiling, dressed and equipped in a super practical way are another of the many details that make it unique. In addition to the bathroom in the dressing room, which has its own shower tray, this apartment has 2 full bathrooms made with exquisite taste and the highest quality materials. And we left for last the part of the house that surprised us the most without a doubt.And it is that on the roof, the apartment has what we consider an oasis in the middle of the city.A 33m2 terrace with views of the sea that is the perfect space for meetings with friends, to rest reading a good book or for endless after-dinner family gatherings. This apartment is unique because it surprises, because it pinches you in the gut when you enter.And that, you who have been looking for a long time, know that it is very difficult to find.

On the house, a passable roof houses some lines where you can hang clothes or simply sit for a while to enjoy the beautiful views while the chirping of birds brings to our spirit the sensation of tranquility and well-being that only contact with nature Can give us. The lower part of the house houses another cave, which is currently used as a store for tools and equipment typical of agriculture, but which, if desired, can be converted into a covered garage, or even more rooms for the house.In front of this cave we have a garage where you can leave the car outdoors but inside the property. In front of the house we find the arable land, which occupies about 600 m² and is completely flat.It has a good number of fruit trees, among which oranges, lemons, tangerines, kiwis, plums, blackberries, pears, apples, peaches, grapes, kaki and avocado stand out, as well as space to plant potatoes, corn, carrots... or whatever. that you want.

The main house -of 220 m2- is located in the centre of an urban plot of 1275 square metres, with two other small buildings that are used as a multi-purpose room with bathroom, where meetings, social meals or simply to listen to music can be held. Another adjoining room at one end of the plot serves as a DIY workshop, or even an atelier for painting. At the main entrance, a hallway leads to the main areas of the house: the main living area, with a large living room and a dining room at different heights with access to the kitchen and a covered terrace that houses a comfortable and sunny sitting room open to the garden. From this hall there is also access to the attic - currently a library - to the basement and to the service area and the night area. The service area also has two other entrances from the garden, through which you can access the kitchen and a bedroom, formerly dedicated to the service staff. In this part of the house there is also a pantry and a laundry room with access to an outside solarium. In the night area, there are the other three bedrooms, one of them being the master bedroom with en-suite bathroom and dressing room. This area is serviced by another large bathroom. The basement houses a wine cellar, a small study, a toilet and the garage with machine room and space for storage or tools. Outside the main house and separated by a relaxing chill out area, there is an adjoining building with bathroom and storage room which is currently used for a variety of purposes: meetings, parties, cinema, exhibitions or a place for meditation could be the destination of this unique piece. It could also be adapted to house a flat independent from the house, although today it is the centre of the owners' social gatherings. The property is only a few minutes away from the access to the ring road, from where you can reach Las Palmas de Gran Canaria in 15 minutes, Maspalomas in 30 minutes and Agaete in 35 minutes.

Those windows are divided into several parts, reaching the floor, having the possibility of opening or closing one or more leaves, depending on the light or how airy we want to have the room at all times. We must highlight the quality of the carpentry and the availability of large built-in closets in the rooms. The property has two entrance doors, the first one leads us to the hall and through the other one we access the kitchen. From the hall we can access the magnificent living room of great amplitude and with a fabulous balcony that allows us to enjoy pleasant open views.

Location The property is located next to Triana and is only separated from Vegueta by the Guiniguada.  The area of Triana, the most important commercial and pedestrian street of the city of Las Palmas, where we will find the park and the station of San Telmo, historical buildings such as the Literary Cabinet, the Pérez Galdós theater and the Pérez Galdós house museum among other museums. Crossing the Guiniguada we arrive at Vegueta which is the foundational neighborhood of the city of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. It was declared a National Historic-Artistic Site in 1973.  The neighborhood owes its name to the fertile plain that extended around the Royal fortification of Las Palmas, initially called ""La Vegueta de Santa Ana"". From then until today it would be the center of the political, religious and administrative life of the island. Today the neighborhood maintains the approximate limits of its foundation, with the ocean to the west and the mountain, now occupied by the neighborhoods of San José, San Juan and San Roque, to the east, the Guiniguada ravine. It maintains its character of administrative center of the city and has acquired a marked tourist character since it is the best preserved historic center of the Canary Islands, where we will find the cathedral and the Plaza de Santa Ana, the Canarian Museum and various historic buildings characterized by the typical Canarian balcony in these narrow streets of Vegueta.",True,good,False,True,2740.0,True,True,False,False,False,False,True,True,flat,"Triana, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria",Flat,,,,,
