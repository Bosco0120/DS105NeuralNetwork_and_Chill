Once inside the house you will begin to discover the reforms that we carry out.The one that you will discover first is that of the flooring.To avoid future humidity problems, we decided to raise it, apply an insulating material and place the current floor, in such a way that it is now much more comfortable and warm.

Back inside, we will go up the stairs to the rest area of the house: On the second floor we will find three large bedrooms, which will provide each member of your family with their place of privacy and tranquility to rest, study or enjoy a good book or a movie in the quiet of the bedroom. And finally, we will access the attic, completely finished and ready to make it everything you have always dreamed of: A beautiful and bucolic bedroom; a great play area for the little ones; a painting studio; a loft, a meeting room; a library; your own movie theater...And you, what happens to you? In short, it is a magnificent house that is completed with great extras: Built-in wardrobes on the first two floors, to lighten the load a little more in the rest of the rooms; split air conditioning, which will help you heat your home depending on the season and will help you save on your electricity bill; white lacquered doors, which replace the original ones...

Each part of the 157 m² house has been designed and decorated with a very special taste so as not to waste any space.

The first floor has also been used as a shop with access via stairs and an elevator, through which you can also access all the floors of the building. The two upper floors have been used as a store for commerce. The roof floor is made up of two roof terraces that are located at two levels of height.
