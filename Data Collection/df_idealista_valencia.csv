The rectangular plot, with its ends at ""Rosinyol"" street (south-east), green area (south) and golf course (north-west), has an area of 900 m2. The house is made up of 3 different floors, with a total constructed area of 835 m2 (1,000 m2 including porches and terraces). The semi-basement floor includes the leisure program and multipurpose rooms, the first floor houses the entire day program in a large open space, and the first floor the night program. It is a minimalist design house with absolute respect for the architectural principles of the modern movement, and with a marked purist and formal character. It presents a high sophistication in the constructive details that confer great singularity to the house. In addition to the semi-basement, the two prisms above ground that make up the air volume of the house, respond to the environment with large openings to the south and east, and with absolute open views towards the golf course. Even the ground floor is raised above the natural slope to allow for longer views. The house has 6 bedrooms, 7 bathrooms and 8 multipurpose rooms, including the indoor pool, gym, games room, wine cellar and cinema, among others. With the aim of making better use of the free outdoor space, a large semi-basement floor is designed with 12 rooms for main use (in addition to the serving rooms themselves), illuminated through two large outdoor patios and two interior patios, in addition to the ramp and the pool itself. Thus, it has a high quality of lighting and natural ventilation, at the same time that the user's privacy is guaranteed in spaces such as the gym, the indoor pool, the multipurpose room, the music room, etc. It also includes a large garage for 5+2 vehicles. The ground floor, practically diaphanous in its distribution, has a triple orientation, east-south-west, and integrates the kitchen, living room, dining room, and the remaining server rooms in the north block. It is a space with excellent short and long 270º views towards the green area and the golf course. In turn, it is directly connected to the south and north-west porches.
