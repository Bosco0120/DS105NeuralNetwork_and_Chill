Unfortunately, it no longer responded to current needs and the technical requirements that are imposed on today's life. Therefore, this property was renovated from the beginning and a villa that is not often found in Mallorca in its type and layout was developed. A very attractively designed driveway through a Mediterranean garden leads to the entrance area of the villa. Its entrance is on the ground floor, the generous entrance portal invites you into an open, light-flooded hall and thus puts the Mallorcan Mediterranean lifestyle in the spotlight. Immediately to the left is an impressive glass-enclosed wine cellar; It is already well stocked for the buyer with about 200 bottles of Mallorcan wine! On this level there are three bedrooms with their en-suite bathrooms, a glazed wellness area, a guest toilet and access to the double garage. An open staircase leads to the roof terrace. On the upper floor of the villa is the main living level of approximately 240 m². The architecture of this level is open and very bright, and consists of a large living room with a seating and dining area, as well as a luxury open kitchen from the Leicht company valued at 50,000 euros. In addition, on the upper floor there is a library, an additional storage room and a guest toilet. The spacious master bedroom with an open en-suite bathroom and a large walk-in closet complete this living level. The particularity of the complete renovation is also expressed in the conversion of the previous hipped roof into a large terrace. Since 2021, the municipality of Calvià no longer allows this type of use of the roof space in new constructions; one more reason to qualify this house as something special. On approx. 200 m² usable roof space you can enjoy your stay in Mallorca in an excellent way, a beautiful sea view rounds off this retreat. On this roof terrace there is a summer kitchen, which perfectly completes the Mediterranean lifestyle both during the day and at night. In addition, there is a pre-installation for the connection of a jacuzzi. The garden area conveys an atmosphere of tranquility.

The entire apartment is renovated including electricity and plumbing. All equipment in the kitchen is from the renovation in 2018.  There are wooden floors throughout the home, marble in the bathrooms, one bathroom has a large steam shower, all bathroom fittings are from Villeroy Boch except the bathtub which is from Porcelanosa. The large wardrobes in the bedrooms are from Dara. Both balconies have sea views and both are about 6 square meters, of which the one outside of what is today the master bedroom is the most square and where you best have room to have dinner. If you move the large, loose wardrobes, this bedroom can become a living room instead. The entire property has AC heating / cooling, plenty of storage and it's pre installed for alarm connection. The property has a lift and something as unusual in Spain as rubbish collection on each floor.  This apartment is on floor 1, but it feels higher up as the property is partly built on a sloap. The community has a large lovely garden with abundant vegetation in the form of lawns, flowers, palm trees and other trees and plants. There is direct access to the sea via a bathing ladder and to two smaller beaches, one on each side of the community. One is hidden and only those who live in the area know that it exists and use it. If you want to sunbath by the pool and listen to the waves of the sea, there is always room as the pool is large and there is good number of sunbeds. It's plenty of parking spaces both under cover and without and even if you do not have a dedicated space, there are always parking opportunities here. The location is close to all services such as a small center with grocery stores and restaurants, of which the harbor restaurant in Cala Nova 5 min walk away is a fantastic social meeting place that also has good food and a wonderful location by the sea. A little further up the hill after Cala Nova you will find Palma Bread, a Swedish bakery where you buy your fresh breakfast bread and all the Swedish pastries you could wish for, almost unnecessarily good and tasty. If you want to see something more than your ""slice of paradise"", bus no. 4 takes you to the beaches of Illeta's in one direction and to Placa España in central Palma in the other direction. The bus passes via restaurant-dense and trendy Santa Catalina and there is a bus every 10 minutes around the clock.  Nearest bus stop is a 5-minute walk from the property. For the golfer, Bendinat Golf is 5 min away by car, Son Vida golf 10m min away and there are a further number of golf courses within 20 minutes drive. Porto Pi shopping center at the entrance to Palma is 4 km away and it takes about 15 minutes to get there by bus, 10 minutes by car and you can also walk in 25 minutes.

The large pool is located on a hill from which you can enjoy the view of the valley and watch the sun go down behind the mountains. The property has its own well which is sufficient for all irrigation. The property's tourist license is for 8 people. Esporles is a charming mountain village at the foot of the Sierra de Traumuntana mountain range.  The village is located in a valley and has a small river that runs straight through the community, which gives that it´s often foggy in the mornings, especially in the autumn when the days are still warm while the nights start to get cool. The whole village is then embedded in a romantic fog reproduced in lots of photos and paintings. To add to the romantic feeling, the majority of the houses are large, beautiful old stone houses in the narrow alleys. The village is divided into the old town, Vilavella and the new town, Vilanova and is especially popular with nature lovers and the island's resident population due to not being a typical tourist route. The most famous attraction in the area is Sa Granja, an impressive historic mansion with museums dating back to Roman times and the island's feudal past. Above all, Esporles year-round is an ideal place to practice outdoor sports such as hiking, cycling and climbing. There is a packed local event calendar with smaller events and festivities, the most famous of which is the annual pastry festival held in October. Over the years, Esporles has attracted a large number of international residents, partly due to the quiet location and proximity to Palma, but also many families since the local school is renown. It's approx 15-20 minutes drive to Palma and 20-25 minutes to the airport.",False,renew,False,9779.0,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,chalet,Esporles,Detached house,Premium,,"[{'name': 'villaType', 'text': 'Villa'}]",independantHouse,

By car, you come from the other direction and via the garage up to the courtyard. The street outside is a small cobbled street and mainly a pedestrian street where only goods transport may drive. This historic family palace was rebuilt in the early 1990s into a multi-family property with 6 neighbors. The property then also had an elevator installed.

The kitchen is well planned and there is plenty of space to have breakfast. Inside the kitchen is a small room with a washing machine, dryer, water heater, and cleaning cabinet. There are windows with good light that are shared with the kitchen. Straight ahead from the entrance is the very generously sized dining room which also serves as both a music room, here is a classical piano and entertainment room as there is also a full-size pool table and it is still a spacious room. Between this room and the beautiful lounge facing the garden is ornate wooden vaults. Aesthetically, you would just as well be in an upper-class apartment in Paris, London or New York, here rests an aura of classic elegance and old money. Inside the dining room are two spacious bedrooms, the larger of which also houses two walk-in closets, one for the husband and one for the wife, an en-suite bathroom, and an office area in addition to additional wardrobes. The smaller, but still very spacious bedroom has a long, full wardrobe wall, this room is located towards the garden and its bathroom also serves as a guest toilet.

The equally famous shopping street Calle Jaime III is just as close. There are 2 parking spaces included in the garage under the property opposite this one. The property has a full-time porter who takes care of the property, inside and out, including the two courtyards, and is also helpful for minor problems in the individual homes.
