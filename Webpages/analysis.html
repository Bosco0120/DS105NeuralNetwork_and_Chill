    <h1>&#128200; Analysis</h1>
    <p>In this section, our objective is to examine the factors that influence rental and sales prices. We will analyze location factors and other relevant variables to gain insights into their impact on real estate prices.<br>


<h2>&#x1F4CD; Location</h2>
     <p><strong>Variations in Rental Price across Provinces</strong> <br></p>
     <p> This analysis examines the variations in rental prices across different provinces in Spain. Understanding the disparities in rental prices can provide valuable insights into regional affordability, demand-supply dynamics, and potential investment opportunities.</p>
     <img src="../Diagrams and Images/rental-price.jpg" alt="rental-price" width = '500'>
   </p>Above shows the rental prices in the 10 selected cities. Rental property prices are driven by various factors such as shifting societal trends, economic considerations, and lifestyle preferences. The country's popular cities, including Barcelona and Madrid has the highest price per area as experience a significant influx of both residents and tourists, creating a competitive rental market in these regions. This creates limited availability of rental properties in these highly desirable locations, coupled with increased demand, and contributes to higher rental prices. Additionally, Spain's vibrant tourism industry plays a significant role in the rental landscape, with coastal regions and popular tourist destinations such as Balears (where Palma is located in) and Malaga, experiencing high demand for holiday rentals. Overall, the rental market in Spain showcases a mix of factors, including location, demand-supply dynamics, economic conditions, and cultural influences, shaping the rental landscape across the country.<p>
    </p>Throughout the project, we will provide detailed analysis and visual representations of the data, allowing for a clear and concise presentation of our findings. We have mainly used Numpy, Pandas, matplotlib, Geopandas and plotnine to clean and wrangle the data, in order to produce specific outputs and graphs that align with our project objective. Additionally, we have explored the underlying factors contributing to the observed correlations between prices and relevant variables. This understanding will help us offer meaningful suggestions and insights to assist potential investors or renters in making sound decisions.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Proximity to City Centre</strong> <br></p>
     <p> This analysis investigates the distribution of rental prices based on their proximity to the city center. By analyzing rental price variations at different distances, it allows for an understanding of how location impacts rental prices and provides insights into the rental market dynamics within urban areas.</p>
     <img src="../Diagrams and Images/rental-price.jpg" alt="rental-price" width = '500'>
   </p>Among the 10 cities for which data has been collected from the Idealista API, there is a noticeable variation in the correlation (represented by the red line) between population density, distance, and the Price by Area. A clear trend emerges: the higher the population density, the stronger the relationship between price and distance. In the majority of cities, specifically 9 out of 10, we observe a negative correlation between price and distance from the city center. This suggests that as the distance increases, the price of residential properties tends to decrease. <p>
    </p>However, Balears stands out as an exception, with a slightly positive correlation between distance and price. This anomaly can be attributed to the fact that Balears is a city comprised of islands, resulting in less developed infrastructure in the city center which causes a lower correlation. Another possible reason could be the unique demand dynamics in Balears. Being a popular tourist destination, the demand for residential properties in Balears might be influenced by factors such as proximity to beaches, amenities, and tourist attractions rather than solely based on distance from the city center. This distinctive demand pattern could lead to a different price relationship compared to other cities where distance from the city center plays a more prominent role. This insight provides valuable information for understanding the pricing dynamics across different cities, emphasizing the influence of population density and geographical factors on residential property prices.</p>

<h3>&#x1F4DD; Other Factors</h3>

<p><strong>Economic Factors</strong> <br></p>
     <p> This analysis examines the correlation between rental prices and the movements of the economic factors by using Gross Domestic Product (GDP). By studying the relationship between rental prices and economic indicators, such as GDP, it helps uncover potential links between the real estate market and the overall economic performance of the country.</p>
     <img src="../Diagrams and Images/rental-price.jpg" alt="rental-price" width = '500'>
    <p> The presented graph illustrates the relationship between Spain's rental prices and its economic fluctuations from 2006 to 2021. Notably, there is a noticeable correlation between rental prices and the country's GDP, indicating that rental prices tend to follow the trajectory of the overall economy. This can be observed by the significant rebound in GDP aligning with the upward trend of rental prices.</p>
   </p>However, compared to other natural economic cycles like recoveries, rental prices in Spain appear to be less responsive to economic shocks. The period from 2008 to 2011, which experienced a significant shock in GDP likely due to the ripple effect of the 2008 macro-environmental events, had a minimal impact on rental prices in the country. This phenomenon can be attributed to the sticky downward effect of necessities, including rent. Owners are less inclined to reduce prices for recurring payments due to factors such as the loss of bargaining power for future prices and loss aversion.<p>
    </p>Overall, this analysis suggests that rental prices in Spain exhibit a somewhat delayed response to economic shocks, potentially influenced by factors related to the nature of essential expenses and psychological considerations of property owners.</p>

<p><strong>Demographics</strong> <br></p>
     <p> This analysis investigates the correlation between rental prices and population density. Understanding the relationship between rental prices and population density can shed light on the housing demand and supply dynamics in densely populated areas, providing insights into market competitiveness and potential investment prospects.</p>
     <img src="../Diagrams and Images/rental-price.jpg" alt="rental-price" width = '500'>
    <p> The graph demonstrates a strong positive correlation between price and population density, as indicated by the steep line of best fit. Notably, 7 out of the 10 cities fall within the 95% confidence interval (red shaded area), suggesting a significant relationship between price by area and population density. Thus, it can be concluded that there is a positive association between real estate prices and population density.</p>
