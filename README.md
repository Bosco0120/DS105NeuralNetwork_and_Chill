## Background and introduction
For our DS105 Project, our group decided to use study property data across ten cities in Spain, utilising the API from Idealista, a sales/rental online platform for Spanish properties. We have performed property analysis with sales data from Idealista, which is a slaes and rental plaform focusing on properties of Spain.
In this project, we have conducted Sales/Rental Market Analysis on 10 cities with in Spain
We have spotted some patterns when playing with the data, which is 

### Replicating the project
In order to replicate the project and final results, please access the source code under the 'Data Collection Code', 'Rental Analysis' and 'Sales Analysis' folders. The datasets that we obtained from Idealista are in the 'Data' folder.

### To Note:
The rental and sales data collection request files require API access from Idealista. You request access at https://developers.idealista.com/access-request. Do note that replication may not result in identical datasets due to the changing nature of property markets.

### Acknowledgments
We would like to extend our sincere gratitude to our esteemed professors for their invaluable guidance and support throughout our data science journey, especially Dr. Jonathan Cardoso Silva for his intersting and entertaining lecturers. Their expertise and dedication have played a crucial role in shaping our understanding of this dynamic field, and it is quite incredible to think that at the start of the year we had little to no programming knowledge at all, and yet here we are. Special thanks to our teacher, Mustafa, for his invaluable guidance in class, and of course to LSE for this educational opportunity.
